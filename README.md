.readlines() turns a file object into a list of strings

.read() turns a file object into continuous string

Use relative path instead of absolute path which makes your data portable. So instead of saying something like `'User/Name/myFiles/allProjects/myData/data2.txt` (absolute path) do this `'../myData/data2.txt` (relative path) where `..` takes you to the parent folder.

#### ../ means one folder up in the directory search. ../../ means two folders up and goes on like ../../../ => three folders up
